#  Rice Leaf Disease Severity Analysis

This repository contains the complete codebase used for my research on **quantifying rice leaf disease severity using image-based heatmap analysis**.

Rice leaf diseases affect crop health and yield, but the severity of these infections varies widely across disease types.  
In this study, I measured lesion severity using heatmap-derived image features to compare how different diseases impact tissue damage.  
These measurements help identify which infections cause more aggressive damage and whether severity can be used as a distinguishing biological trait.
