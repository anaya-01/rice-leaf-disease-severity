Image-based analysis of lesion severity across multiple rice leaf diseases using heatmaps and statistical comparison.
Comparing Lesion Severity Across Rice Leaf Diseases

This repository contains code and analysis for a study investigating whether lesion severity varies across multiple rice leaf diseases. Using Grad-CAM heatmaps from a DenseNet-121 model, we extract image-based severity scores and compare biological damage patterns across disease categories.
